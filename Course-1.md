# Bla ... Bla ... Bla ...

## A little bit history (warm up)

### WHATWG was formed to counter W3C's decision [1]

The WHATWG was formed in response to the slow development of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) web standards and W3C's decision to abandon HTML in favor of XML-based technologies. The WHATWG mailing list was announced on 4 June 2004, two days after the initiatives of a joint Opera–Mozilla position paper had been voted down by the W3C members at the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents.

### W3C adopted WHATWG's HTML5 standard [2]

On 10 April 2007, the Mozilla Foundation, Apple, and Opera Software proposed that the new HTML working group of the W3C adopt the WHATWG’s HTML5 as the starting point of its work and name its future deliverable as "HTML5". On 9 May 2007, the new HTML working group resolved to do that.

### HTML5 was renamed to HTML, as a living standard [3]

HTML formerly known as HTML5 (formerly titled Web Applications 1.0) is the fifth major version of the HTML specification and has been adopted by the W3C as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group. On 19 January 2011, Ian Hickson announced that the standard would now be called HTML instead of HTML5. The specification for HTML will be a living document that will have continuous changes as necessary.

### How does this effect developers?

It means developers need to keep their knowledge updated all the time for new widely implanted features.


## What are we talking about when referencing HTML5

![HTML5 family](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/HTML5-APIs-and-related-technologies-by-Sergey-Mavrody.png/1024px-HTML5-APIs-and-related-technologies-by-Sergey-Mavrody.png)

The meaning varies when the context changes, in our course, the word "HTML5" is referencing mainly the initial WHATWG specification.
